# Hi, I'm Joseph

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=JosephMusenge&color=blue&style=flat)

I'm a student at Rust College, double-majoring in computer science and mathematics. I just love solving problems, and software engineering has allowed me to explore more problems to solve and to innovate.

I'm a **3x hackathon winner** at company hackathons like **JP Morgan** and **Hewlett-Packard (HP)**, and I've twice previously interned at **Microsoft**.

## What I'm Currently Up To

I'm exploring and building fullstack apps, developer tools, and infrastructure to accelerate how we build and ship software. Here's what I'm working on:

- **Fullstack & Infra** – Building tools and systems with TypeScript, C#, and Docker
- **Machine Learning** – Applying ML to solve real problems, not just tutorials
- **Open Source** – Learning in public and shipping side projects like [git-secret-guard](https://github.com/JosephMusenge/git-secret-guard)
